                                Hello, my username is Claasgreeneye also sometimes known as DHCGamer1055. I am person with superior imagination which allows me to be associated 
                                with website and game development projects.  I do see myself as some sort of Innovator even though at the current time I have not invented 
                                anything - in the future this could be a different story. 
                                <br><br>
                                At the moment I am working on this website to include all of my past and current projects. 
                                This website has the sole purpose of acting as a portfolio site where my skills can be presented.

                                Here is a group of skills that I have gained the knowledge on. They vary from beginner to expert. This data was last updated on 
                                March 2024. If a skill is in the beginner section it means that I have a very small understanding on that subject and need more 
                                training. Secondly, anything in the Intermediate section would mean I have a basic knowledge in the skill listed. Finally, anything 
                                in the expert section includes skills that I much better knowledge on.

                            <h5>Roblox Development History</h5>
                            <p>
                                My past in the world of game development and website development is limited. It was only 4 years ago or around that when I 
                                started designing my first Roblox game. Even though I did make games on Roblox in 2017 they were made without any scripting, 
                                no original models and mainly small as I had no experience on how to make Roblox games back then. In 2019 I found myself interested 
                                in learning the language to create games on Roblox which is Luau. The exact game I was working on is unknown as I have changed the 
                                original files with something else. During Mid 2018 I created my first fully created game NukeLab which is a game all about nuking 
                                a small island and see the destruction of the buildings etc. Early 2019; I developed a game called "Ultimate Sad Su Tart Story", which was 
                                created during a trend. To this day this game is the most successful games that I have created.
                                <br><br>
                                Late 2019 marked the year I started the longest Roblox project - named Mucky Driver! This game is all about 
                                players driving vehicles around a map and collecting points to upgrade to a new vehicle. The original name for this 
                                game was to be "Offroader Sim 19" however at the time Roblox moderation decided that was not allowed and that is how I thought of 
                                "Mucky Driver" instead. Mucky Driver includes a vast map, ten plus vehicles and challenges you can do. However, early 2023 I decided the 
                                project is taking too long and the inspiration behind the game was thin so the project was discontinued. The Mucky Driver project has 
                                given me new skills and knowledge on how to create a Roblox game and has provided me experience on what to do and not what to do when 
                                developing a Roblox game. 
                            </p><br><br>
                            <h5>Website Development History</h5>
                            <p>
                                I started to learn how to do website development on a basic level back in 2019 before going to college as I predicted I will need such skills. 
                                Even though in that course i did not require the knowledge on HTML, CSS etc the act of doing so opened a big interest route for me to 
                                go along with. Website development uses my imagination skills and allows me to create things and design. For the past 4 years the interest 
                                in website design has not changed - which is a good thing and a bad one because; I have not exactly explored into CSS/JS frameworks and 
                                creating dynamic webpages, but this I feel this is going to change very soon.

                                In the future I plan to keep developing websites and learning new skills relating to website development like using
                                frameworks and server side programming. Furthermore, I'm planning to start a small business of building websites for clients and their 
                                businesses in my local area. As I learn more about designing websites I should see improvements that open my doors for more job opportunities. 
                                Game development is another skill I hope to improve on in the future - this will either be Roblox experiences or 
                                using another game engine altogether. Additionally, computer building and fixing computers may be another field 
                                I will get into more. I have already made a project where I built a computer system within a certain budget.
