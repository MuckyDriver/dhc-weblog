# TODO LIST as followed...
==========================

1. Accordion script update (Need feedback on this!) (2.0.4 Possibly)

>   Accordion elements which contains long paragraphs may not present the content very well. Resulting in opening it half way through
>   .. this may confuse the user reading the content to miss out on details of text.
>   A possible way to fix this would to add a auto-anchor effect to go to the top of the opened accordion / activated accordion.
    ...


2. Design the transition effect for the projects subdomain. (2.0.4 & 2.0.5)

>   CSS File: Styling / Animation will need to be created as a seperate file. This file will allow the transition animations to be created.
>   Javascript: When a person clicks on the anchor tag / button it will need to start the transition effect. This transition effect will relocate with a #from-another-place
>   .. in which would need to finish the other half of the transition on the subdomains side.
    ...
