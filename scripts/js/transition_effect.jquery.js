        This script will perform the transition effect on certain kind of pages like the main page of the 
        subdomain website and the main pages in the main website.

        when a hashtag of "#t" this will tell the page to carry out the flying to another website
        effect. This effect will be optional eventually as you can always go to the subdomain website via the REAL URL
        of (https://projects.dhcweblogistics.net) if this contains "#t" at the end of the link then the effect

    /* 
        Effect Build Up
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The transition effect will have lots of elements as it needs to animate the effect of floating to another website.

        It will probably include a screenshot of the website and then using animations with 3D preserve will move over to the other
        website showing the main page of that site. 

        Different plans are proposed for this transition effect - I want it to be a cool scene that will make it very unique to my website
        and only my website designs. 

        There are 4 main webpages in the main website of dhcweblogistics so it should not be too difficult to make this effect sort of work.
        This effect mind will have a full screenshot of the webpage in its entirity and will zoom out revealing from the top of the page and then
        doing a special movement to reveal the other website front page.

        The text on the transition image will most likely be blank as in it will be put into blocks instead of letters for the font. This is to ensure
        font styles are void and different styles will not break the transition effect continuation. 

        ... more about it soon (very likely it will be released and completed by the time more info is released.)
